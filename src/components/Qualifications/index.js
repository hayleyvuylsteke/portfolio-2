                I’ve gained a lot of experience in my 10 years as a digital marketer. From B2B to B2C, I've worked with organizations of all sizes to strategize, implement and optimize digital marketing programs.
                <br />
                <br />
                Marketing got more technical, so I did too. In 2021, I completed the University of Toronto Full-stack Web Development program to add to my digital capabilities.

                                    I have spent time in my career working with both B2B and B2C organizations.

                                    <br />
                                    In my time working with B2C organizations, I helped big brands&mdash;AT&amp;T, Sobeys, and Scotiabank&mdash;medium-sized brands&mdash;Bootlegger, Ricki’s and cleo, to small mom and pop shops, strategize, implement and optimize marketing programs. From new iPhone product launch campaigns, to customer acquisition and lifecycle marketing, I have experience in all things B2C.

                                    My experience in B2B SaaS tech marketing has given me strategic insights into both account-based strategy and lead-based lead generation strategies. I am proficient at developing strategies targeting specific accounts, and also verticalized lead-based demand generation programs that exceed corporate targets.
